Java Developers Toolbox contains various java tools and utilities I have created over the years to aid in variety of development tasks.

### Why should I use the Java Toolbox? ###
If you've run into any of the following situations, you may find the Java Toolbox useful.

  * You've got a gazillion jar files and you need to find which jar contains a single class file (or duplicates)
  * You want to decompile class files from 3rd party jar files
  * Your project uses a gazillion jar files and you want to easily visualize the jar dependencies in a graph
  * You just downloaded an opensource project (java, c++, c) and you want some quick stats on how large the code base is and the ratio of comments to code to whitespace
  * All sorts of text formatting goodies - java, xml, sql, quoting, line numbers, etc
  * You want to spy on socket communications between your web browser and a http server
  * Tons more...
